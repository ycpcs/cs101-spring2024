This document describes how to submit labs and assignments to Marmoset.

# Using make

All of the labs and assignments allow submission using the **make** command.  You should run this command (in Cygwin terminal) from within the lab or assignment directory.

For labs and assignments that do *not* have multiple milestones, the command will be

    make submit

For labs and assignments that *do* have multiple milestones, the command will depend on the milestone.  For example, to submit milestone 1, you would use the command

    make submit_ms1

Refer to the assignment description for specific information on how to submit milestones.

# Verifying your submission

Once you have submitted your work, you should verify that you submitted the correct files.  Start by logging into Marmoset and following the link to the CS 101 course.  Click on the lab or assignment you want to verify (e.g., **lab01**, **assign02\_ms1**, **assign04**, etc.)  You should see a list of your submissions that looks something like the following (click for full size):

Click the link for the submission you would like to check (e.g., "Submission 1").  You should see a list of files:

> <a href="img/marmoset-submission-files.png"><img alt="screenshot" style="width: 400px;" src="img/marmoset-submission-files.png" /></a>

Click on the file you want to verify (e.g., "hello.cpp"):

**Due dates**:

* Code due: **Wednesday, March 27th** by 11:59 PM

Getting Started
===============

Start by downloading [CS101\_Assign04\_Sp24.zip](CS101_Assign04_Sp24.zip), saving it in the directory **H:\\CS101**. In Windows File Explorer, navigate to **H:\\CS101**, right click on **CS101\\_Assign04\\_Sp24.zip**, and select **Extract All** to create a **CS101\\_Assign04\\_Sp24** directory with the assignment files.

Start a **Cygwin Bash Shell** and run the following commands:

    cd h:
    cd CS101
    cd CS101_Assign04_Sp24

Using **Notepad++**, open the file

> **H:\\CS101\\CS101\_Assign04\_Sp24\\Roulette.cpp**

You will add your code to this file.

Your Task
=========

The program will prompt the user to enter the initial amount of money they are starting with, obtain a bet type and bet amount (and specific number if the user is betting on a number), then spin of the wheel to determine whether the user won or lost updating the user's account accordingly. The user will then be prompted to play again until they chose to quit or run out of money.

The **main()** game loop is provided **AND MUST NOT BE MODIFIED** other than to *uncomment* the function calls as each function is implemented. Your task is to implement the various functions described below for the game logic.

**Summary of Roulette**:
There are 38 slots, two green (slots 0 and 37), and the rest numbered 1 through 36.

- If you land on green, you automatically lose your bet.
- If you bet odd or even and you win, you win the amount that you bet.
- If you bet on a number and win, you win 35 times your bet.

When you are ready to compile the program, in the Cygwin window type the command

    make

To run the program, type the command

    ./Roulette.exe

Here is an example run (user input in bold):

<pre>
Enter the amount of money you are starting with: $ <b>1000</b>
How do you wish to bet?
1 To bet on Odd
2 To bet on Even
3 To bet on a Particular Number

<b>1</b>

Enter your bet: $ <b>100</b>

The ball landed on 14.
Sorry, you lose $100.00
Your current account is $900.00

Enter 0 to Quit: <b>1</b>
How do you wish to bet?
1 To bet on Odd
2 To bet on Even
3 To bet on a Particular Number

<b>2</b>

Enter your bet: $ <b>100</b>

The ball landed on 8.
That's even, you win $100.00
Your current account is $1000.00

Enter 0 to Quit: <b>1</b>
How do you wish to bet?
1 To bet on Odd
2 To bet on Even
3 To bet on a Particular Number

<b>3</b>

Enter the number you would like to bet on (1 - 36 only): <b>15</b>
Enter your bet: $ <b>100</b>

The ball landed on 15.
That's the number, you win $3500.00
Your current account is $4500.00

Enter 0 to Quit: <b>0</b>
Thank you for playing Roulette.
</pre>

## Roulette Functions

Your program **MUST** implement the following functions:

-   **get_bet_type()** - which takes no parameters, and returns a valid bet type obtained from the user. The function should contain all prompts for the user and validate the type is between 1-3.
-   **get_number()** - which takes no parameters, and returns the user's chosen value between 1-36. The function should contain all prompts for the user and validate the number is between 1-36. This function will be called from **main()** if the bet type is for a particular number.
-   **get_bet_amount()** - which takes the current account as a parameter, and returns a valid bet amount obtained from the user. The function should contain all prompts for the user and validate that the bet is greater than 0 and less than the current account amount.
-   **spin_wheel()** - which takes no parameters, and returns a random number generated between 0-37
-   **evaluate_spin()** - which takes four parameters: the wheel spin, the bet amount, the bet type, and the specific number. It should print the win/loss result and return the amount won/lost.
-   **print_account()** - which takes a parameter for the current amount of the account, and returns no value. The function should simply print out the current amount of money the user has remaining.

**DO NOT CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAMES** or parameter specifications.

## Approach/Hints

### Main

You will want to look through the main function to see how the various functions are used to be sure the data types and order for the parameters and return values match. **Note:** Since the functions are **completely** separate from **main()** you may use any variable names you wish in the function declarations and inside the functions.

### Function declarations

Consider the data types for each parameter and the return type of each function. **Write each function as a standalone routine.** Be sure to add function prototypes before main().

### Spinning the wheel

When the program simulates a spin of the roulette wheel,
it can "randomly" choose an integer in the range
0 through 37 (inclusive) using the expression

    rand() % 38

Grading
=======

Your grade will be determined as follows:

* get_bet_type(): 15
* get_number(): 15
* get_bet_amount(): 20
* spin_wheel(): 10
* evaluate_spin(): 30
* print_account(): 10

We expect you to use good coding style.  Points may be deducted for poor variable names, inconsistent or missing indentation, and/or lack of comments.

Submitting
==========

To submit your code, make sure your **Roulette.cpp** file is saved, and in the Cygwin window type 

    make submit

Enter your Marmoset username and password (which you should have received by email.) Note that your password will not be echoed to the screen. Make sure that after you enter your username and password, you see a message indicating that the submission was successful.

Make sure that you check the file(s) you submitted to ensure that they are correct.  See the instructions for [Verifying your submission](../submitting.html#verifying-your-submission).
